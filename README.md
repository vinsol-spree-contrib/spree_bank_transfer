**"How Bank  Transfer Works" link will open a pop-up window. It will list all steps to complete order with this method.**

* Customer will be able to order by completing the order with this method and can transfer money equal to total order
  value directly into any one of the merchant’s bank account.

* After customer deposits money into merchant’s account, a payment transaction reference number is provided by the bank.   Customer needs to add this payment reference details with the respective order by going to order detail page.

     My Account -> Order no. -> Add details (Payment information column) -> Submit

* Admin will be able to see the payment reference details, added by customer, on the Order detail page.

       Orders -> Order no. ->  Payments

* The order will not be marked Completed  until admin captures the payment as mentioned in step above.

      Note: Admin needs to manually verify the transaction details from his bank account before capturing the payment

* Admin can filter orders which has payment transaction reference number by clicking the check box "only show orders with   bank transfer payment reference number" on "Orders" page.
